# Introduction

Purse seine fishing is a technique that targets and catch entire fish schools in the surface by encircling them with a fishing net called "seine". In the tropical oceans, purse seine is employed to target tropical tunas such as skipjack (*Katsuwonus pelamis*), yellowfin (*Thunnus albacares*), and bigeye (*Thunnus obesus*). In addition to target species, tropical tuna fisheries catch non-target species collectively referred to as bycatch, which can be discarded at sea, retained to be sold on local markets, or consumed on board [@hallMitigatingBycatchTuna2017]. The ratio of bycatch to target tuna catch in the purse seine fleet is considered relatively low in comparison to other fishing gears, such as longlines, that can result in substantial levels of bycatch [@amandeBycatchEuropeanPurse2010; @liuPreliminaryEstimatesBlue2008; @peatmanEstimatingTrendsMagnitudes2023]. However, the impact on pelagic populations and ecosystems may be important, especially for vulnerable long-lived species with low reproductive rates [@dulvyExtinctionRiskConservation2014]. Therefore, it is essential to conduct studies on bycatch rates and their variability over space and time; however, they are often complicated by a lack of bycatch data recorded in fisheries logbooks, taxonomic identification of bycatch species, among other factors.

One of the most reliable sources of information to quantify the amount of bycatch is the use of on-board trained scientific data collectors (a.k.a. observers). When designing an observer sampling program, the level of coverage required will depend on the objectives of the observer program, which might vary from estimating bycatch of protected species, to improving bycatch and catch data for assessment of fish populations, to collecting biological data. In some cases, it may be necessary to have an exact count of the total incidental mortality of bycatch species, especially threatened or endangered species, so a 100% observer coverage may be needed. However, in most cases, a level of 100% observer coverage is not attainable, then the coverage level chosen must ensure that the total bycatch estimate is sufficiently accurate and precise. Then, assuming these observed units are representative of unobserved activity, design-based (e.g., ratio estimators, @cochranSamplingTechniques1977) or model-based (e.g., generalized linear models, @coelhoComparingGLMGLMM2020) approaches can be used to expand the observed bycatch to the remainder of the fishery. One of the main features of ratio estimators is that they do not incorporate a formal underlying statistical model (i.e. are free of any assumptions regarding data structure), and therefore are broadly used in fisheries worldwide, including tuna purse seine fisheries [@amandeBycatchEuropeanPurse2010; @amandePrecisionBycatchEstimates2012].

Despite their widespread use, there are a number of potential issues in applying ratio estimators to estimate bycatch. First, using observed catches of target species or any other measure of effort implicitly makes an assumption about a linear relationship between non-target and target catches [@amandePrecisionBycatchEstimates2012; @fonteneauRelationshipCatchEffort2003]. This may be unrealistic since the distribution of catches of non-target species is often zero-inflated or has a small number of observations containing extremely high values [@ortizAlternativeErrorDistribution2004], and the liner relationship may not hold [@stockUtilitySpatialModelbased2019]. Second, the boundaries of strata used in a ratio estimator can be somewhat arbitrary whenever poststratified boundaries are used. For instance, @amandeBycatchEuropeanPurse2010 defined strata in the Atlantic Ocean based on ecological features for estimating bycatch of the tuna EU purse seine fishery, which may not be adequate for all bycatch species. Third, for rare-event bycatch species, it is common for zero bycatch events to be observed in a given year (ratio estimator is equal to 0), and when bycatch events are observed, the ratio estimator often delivers implausibly high estimates. Lastly, a final and related point is that within each stratum, bycatch rates are assumed to be uniform, while in reality they may vary by season, depth, or other factors.

Spatiotemporal models are increasingly adopted in multiple fisheries applications [@grussSupportingStockAssessment2023; @thorsonGuidanceDecisionsUsing2019; @ducharme-barthImpactsFisheriesdependentSpatial2022], including undertaking bycatch analyses (e.g., @yanSpatiotemporalModelingBycatch2022). These models can provide detailed predictions for any location based on spatial autocorrelation in the observations. However, they are also complicated and require more data to generate robust predictions, which make it unsuitable for data-poor fisheries. In the majority of cases, spatially explicit model-based estimators have increased precision relative to simpler estimators that assign observations to strata [@thorsonGeostatisticalDeltageneralizedLinear2015; @thorsonAccountingSpaceTime2013]. There are a number of additional advantages of spatial models, including the ability to better quantify shifts in distribution [@thorsonModelbasedInferenceEstimating2016] and improved ability to identify fine-scale hotspots of high bycatch [@cosandey-godinApplyingBayesianSpatiotemporal2015]. For tuna fisheries, spatiotemporal models like generalized additive models (GAMs) have recently been used to obtain annual estimates of the most important bycatch species [@dumontModelingBycatchAbundance2024; @peatmanEstimatingTrendsMagnitudes2023].

In this study, we implemented a simulation experiment to evaluate the impacts of different levels of sampling coverage on the annual bycatch estimates derived from design-based and model-based estimators. Our hypothesis is that model-based estimators may provide more accurate bycatch estimates under low sampling coverage scenarios. We used data from the Spanish purse seine tuna fishery operating in the Atlantic Ocean as study case. We performed our analyses differentiating by set type: operating on free schools (FSC) or floating objects (FOB), since they have different bycatch dynamics [@peatmanEstimatingTrendsMagnitudes2023]. Our simulation experiment may be extended to other fisheries with fine-scale bycatch information and support the implementation of sampling programmes across tuna RFMOs.

# Methods

In the following sections, we describe the data used in our analyses, the design and model-based estimators, and the simulation framework. The analyses described below were performed by set type independently.

## Data

Our analyses use data collected by scientific observers aboard tropical purse seine vessels operating in the Atlantic Ocean between 2015 and 2023 (*observers data*). This dataset includes records from both the Spanish scientific monitoring program (EU Data Collection Framework) and the industry-funded Best Practices program, covering Spanish vessels and those under other flags affiliated with ANABAC and OPAGAC associations.

Regardless of the monitoring program, observers followed a standardized protocol. They recorded detailed information for each fishing set, including estimates of target tuna catch and bycatch. For larger bycatch species such as elasmobranchs and billfish, all individuals were counted. For smaller, more abundant species, estimates were often based on visual assessments. In addition to counts, observers conducted length sampling to convert numbers into biomass using species-specific length-weight relationships. Taxa were identified to the species level whenever possible, although in rare cases, only higher taxonomic groups (e.g., family) were recorded. Our analyses use bycatch data in weight since it was available for all taxa in the dataset.

The *effort data* used in our analyses pertain exclusively to the Spanish fleet for the same period and fishing ground. This information is sourced from the logbooks completed by the captains, who are required to record details of each fishing trip, including the location and date of every fishing operation.

This study does not present results for all taxa found in the purse seine fleet's bycatch. We removed tuna-like species from our analyses. Then, a targeted selection of species or groups of species was made to represent three categories: the most abundant taxa, the rare or less prevalent ones, and those considered vulnerable or of special interest. The list of these taxa differed by set type and are presented in @tbl-taxa and @fig-freq-sp.

## Model fitting {#sec-fit}

We use the *sdmTMB* geostatistical spatiotemporal model [@Anderson2024] to fit taxon-specific bycatch per set (in weight) using the observers data. Geostatistical spatiotemporal models have become widely used in fisheries over the last decade [@Anderson2024; @thorsonGuidanceDecisionsUsing2019], and are used when georeferenced data (e.g. each has a corresponding latitude and longitude) with an underlying spatial process is available. *sdmTMB* is written in Template Model Builder (TMB, @kristensenTMBAutomaticDifferentiation2016) and R [@rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2025] for a friendly user interface, and can be viewed as an extension of generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs), but with additional spatial and spatiotemporal components, which are approximated as random effects.

Mathematically, the model structure can be expressed as:

$$u_{s=1:S,t}=f^{-1}(Xb+\omega+\epsilon_t)$$

where $\u$ represents the bycatch predictions at locations $s=1:S$ for a given year $t$, $f^{-1}()$ is the inverse link function, $X$ represents the design matrix of fixed effects, $b$ is the vector of estimated parameters, $\omega$ are the estimated latent spatial effects, and $\epsilon_t$ represents year-to-year latent spatiotemporal effects. $\omega$ represents a spatial intercept that is constant with time while $\epsilon_t$ represents spatial deviations over time, and both are modelled as Gaussian random fields (GRFs):

$$\omega \sim MVN(0,\Sigma_\omega)$$ $$\epsilon \sim MVN(0,\Sigma_\epsilon)$$

where $MVN$ is the multivariate normal distribution, and the covariance matrix $\Sigma$ is modelled with Matérn covariance [@lindgrenExplicitLinkGaussian2011; @maternSpatialVariation1986], which defines the rate at which spatial covariance decays with distance. *sdmTMB* approximates the GRF by relying on the Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) approach using the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation in *R-INLA* to reduce computational costs [@rueApproximateBayesianInference2009]. The first step when using the SPDE approach is to construct the mesh, which, in our case, was composed of triangles covering the studied area with a minimum allowed triangle edge length (*cutoff*) of 1.5 degrees (@suppfig-mesh-fob and @suppfig-mesh-fsc).

For some taxa, especially the less recurrent ones, the inclusion of both the spatial and spatiotemporal terms caused the model failed to converge. For those cases, we reran the model only including the spatial term in order to simplify the model structure.

We used the Tweedie distribution $Tweedie(\mu, \phi^2,p)$, where $1<p<2$, and a log link function [@tweedieIndexWhichDistinguishes1984]. The Tweedie model is an extension of compound Poisson model derived from the stochastic process where the weight of the response variable (e.g., catch data) has a gamma distribution and has an advantage of handling the zero-catch data in a unified way [@shonoApplicationTweedieDistribution2008]. For fixed effects, we incorporated the year and quarter effects as factors, and the target tuna catch (the sum of skipjack, yellowfin, and bigeye tunas) as a continuous covariate.

For all fitted models, we checked that the maximum gradient was smaller than 1e-03, the Hessian was invertible, and standard errors were estimated for all fixed effects and did not look unreasonably large ("safety checks"). We then used the *DHARMa* R package [@hartigDHARMaResidualDiagnostics2022] to evaluate the model residuals. Standard raw residuals are not always appropriate when using generalized linear models, and other types of residuals are commonly used instead. *DHARMa* uses a simulation-based approach to create readily interpretable scaled (quantile) residuals for generalized linear mixed models. We analyzed two plots produced by *DHARMa*: 1) the QQ plot residuals, which detects overall deviations from the expected distribution, and 2) the residual vs. predicted plot, which detects trends in residuals along model predictions and simulation outliers.

## Simulation {#sec-sim}

One of the advantages of using models like *sdmTMB* is that we can simulate new observations using a new dataset ("prediction dataset") containing the same covariates used when fitting the model. In our case, we used the effort data as the prediction dataset and simulated new observations (i.e., bycatch in weight for every fishing set in the effort data) using the fitted models for each taxa in @sec-fit. These simulated observations keep the statistical properties of the original bycatch data. We refer to the effort data with simulated bycatch observations as the *simulated data*.

We then took a subset of the simulated data with different sampling coverage scenarios: 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 70%, and 90%. To approximate real-case situations, we performed this subsetting stratified by year, and then selected the fishing trips observed under that sampling coverage scenario. The obtained *sampled data* represent the observers data that would have been obtained from an observers program with the specified sampling coverage. @suppfig-map-loc1 and @suppfig-map-loc2 show how the presence of a common and rare taxa, respectively, in the sampled data is affected by the sampling coverage.

Then, using the sampled data, we estimated the annual bycatch using two approaches: ratio and model-based estimator, which are described below.

### Ratio estimator

We used the spatially-stratified bycatch–over-target catch ratio. For a given taxon, the ratio ($R_{y,a}$) was calculated for every defined $5\times 5^\circ$ grid $a$ in the study area and year $y$ as follows:

$$R_{y,a} = \frac{B_{y,a}}{T_{y,a}}$$

where $BY_{y,a}$ is the total bycatch and $TG_{y,a}$ the total tropical tuna catch obtained from the sampled data. In a few cases, there could happen that $T_{y,a}=0$ (e.g., sets with target catch equal to zero or "null sets"), so $R_{y,a}$ could not be calculated. Therefore, exclusively for those cases, we assumed that $R_{y,a}=0$.

Then, assuming a linear relationship between bycatch and target catch, we calculated the total bycatch:

$$\hat{B}_{y,a} = R_{y,a}T^\ast_{y,a}$$

where $T^\ast_{y,a}$ is the total target catch in grid $a$ and year $y$ obtained from the effort data. Especially for low sampling coverage scenarios, it is expected to have missing $R_{y,a}$ values for some grids due to the sampled data do not cover all the grids in the study area. Therefore, exclusively for those grids, $R_{y,a}$ was calculated using $B_{y}/T_{y}$, where $B_{y}$ and $T_{y}$ are the total bycatch and target catch in the whole area, respectively, derived from the information in the sampled data.

Finally, the annual bycatch estimate is calculated: $\hat{B}_{y}=\sum_a \hat{B}_{y,a}$.

### Model-based estimator

We followed the same modelling framework described in @sec-fit. Once the fitted model is obtained, we then made predictions using the effort data, which generated predicted bycatch observations for every fishing set in that dataset. Then, we summed the predicted bycatch values per year to estimate the annual bycatch $\hat{B}_{y}$.

Especially when the sampling coverage is low, we could find cases when a given taxon is not detected in the sampled data (i.e., bycatch equal to zero for all fishing sets). In those cases, the model-based estimator was not run and we assumed $\hat{B}_{y}=0$ for all years. Another special case is when the model did not pass the safety checks (see @sec-fit). In those cases, we were not able to produce bycatch estimates $\hat{B}_{y}$ and reported the rate of model failure.

## Performance

The procedure explained in @sec-sim was repeated 100 times ("replicates") with different seeds to produce the simulated data, therefore we obtained 100 annual bycatch estimates by the ratio and model-based estimators for each taxa $q$. We calculated the relative error for every replicate $i$: $RE_{i,q,y}=(\hat{B}_{i,q,y} - B_{i,q,y})/B_{i,q,y}$, where $B_{i,q,y}$ represents the true annual bycatch obtained from the simulated data. The width of the 95% quantile of RE over replicates was used as a measure of precision and the median as a proxy of bias, and these metrics were used to compare the performance of the ratio and model-based estimators.

# Results

## FOB sets

For common taxa, the model-based estimator converged for all replicates and included both the spatial $\omega$ and spatiotemporal $\epsilon$ terms when the sampling coverage was larger than 20% (@fig-conv-fob). However, when the sampling coverage was lower than 20%, the model-based estimator still converged but had a simpler structure by only including the spatial term in most replicates. Likewise, for taxa with special interest, the model-based estimator still converged for intermediate and large sampling coverage, although we observed that the model failed for some taxa (e.g., *Makaira nigricans* or Mobulidae) when the sampling coverage was lower than 10% (@fig-conv-fob). For rare taxa, the model-based estimator usually failed when the sampling coverage was low and needed a coverage larger than 50% to provide estimates. The model-based estimator was not even run for Alopiidae under low sampling coverage scenarios due to missing observations for this taxon (@fig-conv-fob).

Regarding the performance of the assessed estimators, we noticed that the model-based estimator outperformed the ratio estimator for most taxa, showing smaller bias and larger precision particularly for low sampling coverage scenarios (@fig-re-fob). The ratio estimator started to display negative bias and worse precision for most taxa when the sampling coverage was lower than 30%, but performed quite well for a sampling coverage larger than 40%, especially for most common taxa. We observed the worst precision for rare taxa for both estimators, even under large sampling coverage. For very rare taxa like Alopiidae, the large negative bias (-100%) was likely caused by the miss of this taxon in the sample data when the sampling coverage was low. When analyzing the bias and precision over the years, we found that they did not largely vary, always observing a better performance of the model-based estimator under low sampling coverage (@suppfig-reyr-co-fob, @suppfig-reyr-si-fob and @suppfig-reyr-ra-fob). 

## FSC sets

For common taxa, the model-based estimator converged for most replicates when the sampling coverage was larger than 10%, although it was only able to include the spatial term $\omega$ in most cases (@fig-conv-fsc). However, when the sampling coverage was equal or lower than 10%, the model-based estimator failed to converge in most replicates. For taxa with special interest, the model-based estimator still converged for intermediate and large sampling coverage, usually larger than 30%, although we observed that the model generally failed for some taxa like *Makaira nigricans* even when the sampling coverage was large (@fig-conv-fsc). For rare taxa like Lamnidae, the model-based estimator generally failed to converge even for large sampling coverage scenarios.

Regarding the performance of the assessed estimators, we noticed that the model-based estimator generally outperformed the ratio estimator for most taxa, showing smaller bias particularly for low sampling coverage scenarios (@fig-re-fsc). However, unlike the FOB sets, the model-based estimator still showed bad precision even under large sampling coverage. The ratio estimator started to display negative bias and worse precision for most taxa when the sampling coverage was lower than 50%, but was relatively unbiased for larger sampling coverage, especially for most common taxa. We observed the worst precision for rare taxa for both estimators, even under large sampling coverage. When analyzing the bias and precision over the years, we found that they did not largely vary, always observing a better performance of the model-based estimator under low sampling coverage (@suppfig-reyr-co-fsc, @suppfig-reyr-si-fsc and @suppfig-reyr-ra-fsc).
