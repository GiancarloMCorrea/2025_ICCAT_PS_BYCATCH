**Abstract**

<br>

Investigating the effects of fishing on non-targeted (bycatch) species is crucial for conservation and management matters. On-board observers information provides a valuable source for estimating bycatch; however, due to several factors such as their high costs and logistic challenges, observer programmes usually cover a small percentage of the fishery. In order to estimate bycatch for the unobserved fishing activity, a ratio estimator is commonly used, which assumes a linear relationship between the ratio of bycatch and total target catch or effort. In this study, we implemented a simulation experiment to evaluate the performance of the ratio and model-based estimator under different sampling coverage scenarios. We used the Spanish tuna purse seine fishery operating in the Atlantic Ocean as a case study. Our results suggest that the ratio estimator may produce bycatch estimates with large negative bias (i.e., underestimation) when the sampling coverage is lower than 20%, even for common taxa. Conversely, the model-based estimator produced unbiased estimates even under low sampling coverage scenarios. However, the model-based estimator may be only suitable for taxa with intermediate and high prevalence in the bycatch composition. This study presents a simulation framework that may be applied to other moderately data-rich fisheries and supports the implementation of observer programmes from which appropriate estimates of bycatch for species of interest to the Commission can be obtained.

# Introduction

Purse seine fishing is a technique that targets and catch entire fish schools on the surface by encircling them with a fishing net called "seine". In the tropical oceans, purse seine is employed to target tropical tunas such as skipjack (*Katsuwonus pelamis*), yellowfin (*Thunnus albacares*), and bigeye (*Thunnus obesus*). In addition to target species, tropical tuna fisheries catch non-target species collectively referred to as bycatch, which can be released , discarded at sea, or retained (e.g., due to regulatory requirements, to be sold on local markets, or consumed on board) [@hallMitigatingBycatchTuna2017]. The ratio of bycatch to target tuna catch in the purse seine fleet is considered relatively low in comparison to other fishing gears, such as longlines, that can result in substantial levels of bycatch [@amandeBycatchEuropeanPurse2010; @liuPreliminaryEstimatesBlue2008; @peatmanEstimatingTrendsMagnitudes2023]. However, the impact on pelagic populations and ecosystems may be important, especially for some vulnerable long-lived species with low reproductive rates [@dulvyExtinctionRiskConservation2014]. Therefore, it is essential to conduct studies on bycatch rates and their variability over space and time; however, these are often complicated by a lack of bycatch data recorded in fisheries logbooks, difficulties in taxonomic identification of bycatch species, and other factors.

One of the most reliable sources of information to quantify the amount of bycatch is the use of on-board trained scientific data collectors (a.k.a. observers). When designing a scientific observer sampling program, the required level of coverage will depend on the objectives of the observer program, which might vary from estimating bycatch of protected species, to improving bycatch and catch data for assessment of fish populations, or collecting biological data. In some cases, it may be necessary to have an exact count of the total incidental mortality of bycatch species, especially threatened or endangered species, so a 100% observer coverage may be needed. However, in most cases, a level of 100% observer coverage is not attainable, then the coverage level chosen must ensure that the total bycatch estimate is sufficiently accurate and precise. Then, assuming these observed units are representative of unobserved activity, design-based (e.g., ratio estimators, @cochranSamplingTechniques1977) or model-based (e.g., generalized linear models, @coelhoComparingGLMGLMM2020) approaches can be used to expand the observed bycatch to the remainder of the fishery. One of the main features of ratio estimators is that they do not incorporate a formal underlying statistical model (i.e., they are free of any assumptions regarding data structure), and therefore are broadly used in fisheries worldwide, including tuna purse seine fisheries [@amandeBycatchEuropeanPurse2010; @amandePrecisionBycatchEstimates2012; @hallBycatchNontunaCatch2013].

Despite their widespread use, there are a number of potential issues in applying ratio estimators to estimate bycatch. First, using observed catches of target species or any other measure of effort implicitly makes an assumption about a linear relationship between non-target and target catches [@amandePrecisionBycatchEstimates2012; @fonteneauRelationshipCatchEffort2003]. This may be unrealistic since the distribution of catches of non-target species is often zero-inflated or has a small number of observations containing extremely high values [@ortizAlternativeErrorDistribution2004], and the assumed linear relationship may not hold [@stockUtilitySpatialModelbased2019]. Second, the boundaries of strata used in a ratio estimator can be somewhat arbitrary whenever poststratified boundaries are used. For instance, @amandeBycatchEuropeanPurse2010 defined strata in the Atlantic Ocean based on ecological features for estimating bycatch of the tuna EU purse seine fishery, which may not be adequate for all bycatch species. Third, for rare-event bycatch species, it is common for zero bycatch events to be observed in a given year (ratio estimator is equal to 0), and when bycatch events are observed, the ratio estimator often delivers implausibly high estimates. Lastly, a final and related point is that within each stratum, bycatch rates are assumed to be uniform, while in reality they may vary by season or environmental conditions.

Spatiotemporal models are increasingly adopted in multiple fisheries applications [@grussSupportingStockAssessment2023; @thorsonGuidanceDecisionsUsing2019; @ducharme-barthImpactsFisheriesdependentSpatial2022], including undertaking bycatch analyses (e.g., @yanSpatiotemporalModelingBycatch2022). These models can provide detailed predictions for any location based on spatial autocorrelation in the observations. However, they are also complicated and require more data to generate robust predictions, which makes them unsuitable for data-poor fisheries. In the majority of cases, spatially explicit model-based estimators have increased precision relative to simpler estimators that assign observations to strata [@thorsonGeostatisticalDeltageneralizedLinear2015; @thorsonAccountingSpaceTime2013]. There are a number of additional advantages of spatial models, including the ability to better quantify shifts in distribution [@thorsonModelbasedInferenceEstimating2016] and improved ability to identify fine-scale hotspots of high bycatch [@cosandey-godinApplyingBayesianSpatiotemporal2015]. For tuna fisheries, spatiotemporal models like generalized additive models (GAMs) have recently been used to obtain annual estimates of the most important bycatch species [@dumontModelingBycatchAbundance2024].

In this study, we implemented a simulation experiment to evaluate the impacts of different levels of sampling coverage on the annual bycatch estimates derived from a ratio and model-based estimators. Our hypothesis is that model-based estimators may provide more accurate bycatch estimates under low sampling coverage scenarios. We used data from the Spanish purse seine tuna fishery operating in the Atlantic Ocean as a case study. We performed our analyses independently for each fishing mode: sets on free schools (FSC) or floating objects (FOB), since they have different bycatch composition and magnitude [@peatmanEstimatingTrendsMagnitudes2023]. Our simulation experiment may be extended to other fisheries with fine-scale bycatch information and support the implementation of sampling programmes across tuna RFMOs.

# Methods

In the following sections, we describe the data used in our analyses, the ratio and model-based estimators, and the simulation framework. The analyses described below were performed by fishing mode independently.

## Data

Our analyses use data collected by scientific observers on board tropical tuna purse seine vessels operating in the Atlantic Ocean between 2015 and 2023 (*observers data*). This dataset includes records from both the Spanish scientific monitoring program (EU Data Collection Framework) and the industry-funded Best Practices program, covering Spanish-owned vessels under various flags, from shipowners member of the tuna purse seine associations ANABAC and OPAGAC-AGAC.

Regardless of the monitoring program, observers follow a standardized protocol. They record detailed information for each fishing set, including estimates of bycatch and weight categories for target tuna catch, which are then used to estimate total target catch. For larger bycatch species such as elasmobranchs and billfishes, all individuals are counted. For smaller, more abundant species, estimates are often based on visual assessments and estimated in weight. In addition to counts, observers also conduct length sampling to convert numbers into biomass using species-specific length-weight relationships when weight estimates are not available. Taxa are identified to the species level whenever possible, although in rare cases, only higher taxonomic groups (e.g., family) are recorded. Our analyses use bycatch data in weight since it was available for all taxa in the dataset.

The *effort data* used in our analyses pertain exclusively to the Spanish fleet for the same period and fishing ground. This information is sourced from the logbooks completed by the captains, who are required to record details of each fishing trip, including the location, fishing mode, and date of every fishing operation. @suppfig-nobs-fob and @suppfig-nobs-fsc display the number of sets by fishing mode in the observers and effort data.

This study does not present results for all taxa found in the purse seine fleet's bycatch. We removed tuna-like species from our analyses. Then, a targeted selection of species or groups of species was made to represent three categories: the most abundant taxa, the rare or less prevalent ones, and those considered vulnerable or of special interest. The list of these taxa differed by fishing mode and is presented in @tbl-taxa and @fig-freq-sp. Some taxa are included at the species level, while others group multiple species within the same family. In these cases, @tbl-taxa reports the predominant species, if present.

## Model fitting {#sec-fit}

We use the *sdmTMB* geostatistical spatiotemporal model [@Anderson2024] to fit taxon-specific bycatch per set (in weight) using the observers data. Geostatistical spatiotemporal models have become widely used in fisheries over the last decade [@Anderson2024; @thorsonGuidanceDecisionsUsing2019], and are used when georeferenced data (e.g., each has a corresponding latitude and longitude) with an underlying spatial process is available. *sdmTMB* is written in Template Model Builder (TMB, @kristensenTMBAutomaticDifferentiation2016) and R [@rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2025] for a friendly user interface, and can be viewed as an extension of generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs), but with additional spatial and spatiotemporal components, which are approximated as random effects.

Mathematically, the model structure can be expressed as:

$$u_{s=1:S,t}=f^{-1}(Xb+\omega+\epsilon_t)$$

where $u$ represents the bycatch predictions at locations $s=1:S$ for a given year $t$, $f^{-1}()$ is the inverse link function, $X$ represents the design matrix of fixed effects, $b$ is the vector of estimated parameters, $\omega$ are the estimated latent spatial effects, and $\epsilon_t$ represents year-to-year latent spatiotemporal effects. $\omega$ represents a spatial intercept that is constant with time, while $\epsilon_t$ represents spatial deviations over time, and both are modelled as Gaussian random fields (GRFs):

$$\omega \sim MVN(0,\Sigma_\omega)$$ $$\epsilon \sim MVN(0,\Sigma_\epsilon)$$

where $MVN$ is the multivariate normal distribution, and the covariance matrix $\Sigma$ is modelled with Matérn covariance [@lindgrenExplicitLinkGaussian2011; @maternSpatialVariation1986], which defines the rate at which spatial covariance decays with distance. *sdmTMB* approximates the GRF by relying on the Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) approach using the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation in *R-INLA* to reduce computational costs [@rueApproximateBayesianInference2009]. The first step when using the SPDE approach is to construct the mesh, which, in our case, was composed of triangles covering the studied area with a minimum allowed triangle edge length (*cutoff*) of 1.5 degrees (@suppfig-mesh-fob and @suppfig-mesh-fsc). The mesh discretizes a continuous spatial or spatiotemporal phenomenon into a set of discrete points (i.e., triangles), which allows for the computation of spatial autocorrelation and enables the model to estimate and interpolate the continuous field.

For some taxa, especially the less recurrent ones, the inclusion of both the spatial and spatiotemporal terms may cause convergence issues. For those cases, we reran the model only including the spatial term in order to simplify the model structure.

We used the Tweedie distribution $Tweedie(\mu, \phi^2,p)$, where $1<p<2$, and a log link function [@tweedieIndexWhichDistinguishes1984]. The Tweedie model is an extension of the compound Poisson model derived from the stochastic process where the weight of the response variable (e.g., catch data) has a gamma distribution and has the advantage of handling the zero-catch data in a unified way [@shonoApplicationTweedieDistribution2008]. For fixed effects, we incorporated the year and quarter effects as factors, and the target tuna catch (the sum of skipjack, yellowfin, and bigeye tunas) as a continuous covariate.

For all fitted models, we checked that the maximum gradient was smaller than 1e-03, the Hessian was invertible, and standard errors were estimated for all fixed effects and did not look unreasonably large ("sanity checks"). We then used the *DHARMa* R package [@hartigDHARMaResidualDiagnostics2022] to evaluate the model residuals. Standard raw residuals are not always appropriate when using generalized linear models, and other types of residuals are commonly used instead. *DHARMa* uses a simulation-based approach to create readily interpretable scaled (quantile) residuals for generalized linear mixed models. We analyzed two plots produced by *DHARMa*: 1) the QQ plot residuals, which detect overall deviations from the expected distribution, and 2) the residual vs. predicted plot, which detects trends in residuals along model predictions and simulation outliers.

## Simulation {#sec-sim}

One of the advantages of using models like *sdmTMB* is that we can simulate new observations using a new dataset ("prediction dataset") containing the same covariates used when fitting the model. In our case, we used the effort data as the prediction dataset and simulated new observations (i.e., bycatch in weight for every fishing set in the effort data) using the fitted models for each taxa in @sec-fit. These simulated observations keep the statistical properties of the original bycatch data. We refer to the effort data with simulated bycatch observations as the *simulated data*.

We then took a subset of the simulated data with different sampling coverage scenarios: 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 70%, and 90%. To approximate real-case situations, we performed this subsetting stratified by year, and then randomly selected the fishing trips observed under that sampling coverage scenario. The obtained *sampled data* represent the observers data that would have been obtained from an observers program with the specified sampling coverage. @suppfig-map-loc1 and @suppfig-map-loc2 show how the presence of a common and rare taxa, respectively, in the sampled data is affected by the sampling coverage.

Then, using the sampled data, we estimated the annual bycatch using two approaches: ratio and model-based estimator, which are described below.

### Ratio estimator

We used the spatially-stratified bycatch–over-target catch ratio. For a given taxon, the ratio ($R_{y,a}$) was calculated for every defined $5\times 5^\circ$ grid $a$ in the study area and year $y$ as follows:

$$R_{y,a} = \frac{B_{y,a}}{T_{y,a}}$$

where $B_{y,a}$ is the total bycatch and $T_{y,a}$ the total tropical tuna catch obtained from the sampled data. In a few cases, there could happen that $T_{y,a}=0$ (e.g., sets with target catch equal to zero or "null sets"), so $R_{y,a}$ could not be calculated. Therefore, exclusively for those cases, we assumed that $R_{y,a}=0$.

Then, assuming a linear relationship between bycatch and target catch, we calculated the total bycatch:

$$\hat{B}_{y,a} = R_{y,a}T^\ast_{y,a}$$

where $T^\ast_{y,a}$ is the total target catch in grid $a$ and year $y$ obtained from the effort data. Especially for low sampling coverage scenarios, it is expected to have missing $R_{y,a}$ values for some grids due to the sampled data do not cover all the grids in the study area. Therefore, for those grids only, $R_{y,a}$ was calculated as $B_{y}/T_{y}$, where $B_{y}$ and $T_{y}$ are the total bycatch and target catch in the whole area, respectively, derived from the information in the sampled data.

Finally, the annual bycatch estimate is calculated: $\hat{B}_{y}=\sum_a \hat{B}_{y,a}$.

### Model-based estimator

We followed the same modelling framework described in @sec-fit. Once the fitted model is obtained, we then made predictions using the effort data, which generated predicted bycatch observations for every fishing set in that dataset. Then, we summed the predicted bycatch values per year to estimate the annual bycatch $\hat{B}_{y}$.

Especially when the sampling coverage is low, we could find cases when a given taxon is not detected in the sampled data (i.e., bycatch equal to zero for all fishing sets). In those cases, the model-based estimator was not run, and we assumed $\hat{B}_{y}=0$ for all years. Another special case is when the model did not pass the sanity checks (see @sec-fit). In those cases, we were not able to produce model-based bycatch estimates $\hat{B}_{y}$ and reported the rate of model failure.

## Performance

The procedure explained in @sec-sim was repeated 100 times ("replicates") with different seeds to produce the simulated data, therefore we obtained 100 annual bycatch estimates by the ratio and model-based estimators for each taxa $q$. We calculated the relative error for every replicate $i$: $RE_{i,q,y}=(\hat{B}_{i,q,y} - B_{i,q,y})/B_{i,q,y}$, where $B_{i,q,y}$ represents the true annual bycatch obtained from the simulated data. The width of the 95% quantile of RE over replicates was used as a measure of precision and the median as a proxy of bias, and these metrics were used to compare the performance of the ratio and model-based estimators.

# Results

## Fishing object sets

For common taxa, the model-based estimator converged for all replicates and included both the spatial $\omega$ and spatiotemporal $\epsilon$ terms when the sampling coverage was larger than 20% (@fig-conv-fob). However, when the sampling coverage was lower than 20%, the model-based estimator still converged but had a simpler structure by only including the spatial term in most replicates. Likewise, for taxa with special interest, the model-based estimator still converged for intermediate and large sampling coverage, although we observed that the model failed to pass the sanity check for some taxa (e.g., *Makaira nigricans* or Mobulidae) when the sampling coverage was lower than 10% (@fig-conv-fob). For rare taxa, the model-based estimator usually failed when the sampling coverage was low and needed a coverage larger than 50% to provide estimates. The model-based estimator was not even run for Alopiidae under low sampling coverage scenarios due to missing observations for this taxon (@fig-conv-fob).

Regarding the performance of the assessed estimators, we noticed that the model-based estimator outperformed the ratio estimator for most taxa, showing smaller bias and better precision, particularly for low sampling coverage scenarios (@fig-re-fob). The ratio estimator started to display negative bias and worse precision for most taxa when the sampling coverage was lower than 30%, but performed quite well for a sampling coverage larger than 40%, especially for the most common taxa. We observed the worst precision for rare taxa for both estimators, even under large sampling coverage. For very rare taxa like Alopiidae, the large negative bias (-100%) was likely caused by the omission of this taxon in the sample data when the sampling coverage was low. When analyzing the bias and precision over the years, we found that they did not largely vary, always observing a better performance of the model-based estimator under low sampling coverage (@suppfig-reyr-co-fob, @suppfig-reyr-si-fob and @suppfig-reyr-ra-fob).

## Free-school sets

For common taxa, the model-based estimator converged for most replicates when the sampling coverage was larger than 10%, although it was only able to include the spatial term $\omega$ in most cases (@fig-conv-fsc). However, when the sampling coverage was equal to or lower than 10%, the model-based estimator failed to converge in most replicates. For taxa with special interest, the model-based estimator still converged for intermediate and large sampling coverage, usually larger than 30%, although we observed that the model generally failed for some taxa, like *Makaira nigricans,* even when the sampling coverage was large (@fig-conv-fsc). For rare taxa like Lamnidae, the model-based estimator generally failed to converge even for large sampling coverage ($> 50$%) scenarios.

Regarding the performance of the assessed estimators, we noticed that the model-based estimator generally outperformed the ratio estimator for most taxa, showing smaller bias, particularly for low sampling coverage scenarios ($< 20$%, @fig-re-fsc). However, unlike the FOB sets, the model-based estimator still showed poor precision even under large sampling coverage. The ratio estimator started to display negative bias and worse precision for most taxa when the sampling coverage was lower than 50%, but was relatively unbiased for larger sampling coverage, especially for the most common taxa. We observed the worst precision for rare taxa for both estimators, even under large sampling coverage ($> 50$%). When analyzing the bias and precision over the years, we found that they did not vary much, consistently showing better performance of the model-based estimator under low sampling coverage (@suppfig-reyr-co-fsc, @suppfig-reyr-si-fsc and @suppfig-reyr-ra-fsc).

# Discussion

In this study, we explored the impacts of different levels of sampling coverage on bycatch estimates of the Spanish tuna purse seine fishery operating in the Atlantic Ocean. We evaluated the performance of two types of estimators: ratio estimator, widely used to derive annual bycatch estimates for several fisheries worldwide [@stockUtilitySpatialModelbased2019], and model-based estimator, following the geostatistical spatiotemporal modelling approach [@thorsonGeostatisticalDeltageneralizedLinear2015]. Our results suggest that the performance of the ratio estimator is negatively impacted by sampling coverage scenarios usually lower than 20%, producing underestimation and poor precision in bycatch estimates, even for the most common taxa. However, for scenarios with sampling coverage larger than 40%, the performance of both estimators was comparable. In addition, this study also suggests that our model-based estimator is a recommended alternative for prevalent taxa, especially under low sampling coverage, since it may provide unbiased bycatch estimates.

There are a few considerations we need to be aware of when using a model-based estimator like the one used in our study. First, spatiotemporal models require fine-scale information; therefore, they may only be suitable for moderately data-rich fisheries (i.e., data on longitude and latitude of fishing operations is available and observers program covers reasonably well the fishing ground). Second, as shown in our results, the convergence rate of the model-based estimator may decrease under low sampling coverage scenarios. In our simulation, we only attempted to improve convergence rates by making the model simpler (i.e., excluding the spatiotemporal term $\epsilon$); however, other strategies may be also explored in real-case situations. For example, modifying the mesh size used in the model (@suppfig-mesh-fob and @suppfig-mesh-fsc), testing the exclusion/inclusion of covariates, or specifying other statistical families (e.g., delta families) might improve the model convergence. However, we did not explore those options in our study since they might be unsuitable in a simulation experiment where hundreds of replicates are run. Third, a spatiotemporal model-based estimator may not perform well for taxa with very low prevalence (i.e., rare taxa). For example, we found that the model-based estimator performed quite badly for Alopiidae (@fig-re-fob), which had a frequency of less than 1% in FOB sets. Lastly, like in CPUE standardizations [@hoyleCatchUnitEffort2024], a model-based approach may produce slightly different annual bycatch estimates when the data to fit the model is modified, which typically happens when a new year of information is available.

Spatiotemporal models are only one type of model-based approach that may be explored. @dumontModelingBycatchAbundance2024 used random forest and GAMs to estimate bycatch of the most common taxa in the French tuna purse seine fishery, while @peatmanEstimatingTrendsMagnitudes2023 used generalized estimating equations [@prenticeEstimatingEquationsParameters1991], an extension of generalized linear models, to estimate bycatch for Pacific tuna fisheries. @longMachineLearningApproach2024 used an ensemble random forest for bycatch estimation of protected species, which showed a good performance for species with an interaction rate greater than 2% and might be recommended for rare bycatch taxa [@sidersEnsembleRandomForests2020]. See @yinRoadmapGeneratingAnnual2024 for a thorough review of the main methods used to estimate bycatch. Therefore, we recommend further investigation on the performance of different model-based estimators under diverse circumstances since the results might be case-specific [@stockUtilitySpatialModelbased2019].

For the tuna purse seine fishery in the Pacific Ocean, @lennert-codyEffectsSampleSize2001 used data from on-board observers and resampling techniques to explore the impacts of the sampling coverage on the bycatch estimates of three species groups, recommending a minimum coverage of 20-33%. In that study, the observers program covered \$\sim$97% of the fishing trips (1996-1999); therefore, different levels of subsampling of the observers data to evaluate its effect on bycatch estimates may be sufficient and predicting bycatch estimates in the effort data as done in @sec-fit is not needed. In the Indian Ocean, @sanchezOptimumSampleNumber2007 used observers data ($\sim 5\$% coverage) from the tuna purse seine fishery and Monte Carlo techniques to evaluate the impacts of sampling coverage on bycatch estimates of sharks, recommending a coverage of 25%. These two studies agree with the results obtained from our simulation experiment. We generally found that a sampling coverage lower than 20% may, overall, largely underestimate bycatch estimates if the ratio estimator is used. Therefore, we recommend achieving a minimum of 20% sampling coverage for tuna purse seine fisheries if the ratio estimator is used. In case that level of coverage cannot be attained, we recommend exploring alternative estimators that are robust to sampling coverage scenarios lower than 20% (e.g., model-based estimator). The progress in electronic monitoring in the last decade [@vanhelmondElectronicMonitoringFisheries2020] may help to make the implementation of onboard observer programmes more feasible. Finally, these conclusions may apply to tuna purse seine fisheries; however, we recommend carrying out independent analyses for other fisheries with different gears, fishing grounds, and bycatch composition and magnitudes.

<!-- For example, there are ongoing efforts in the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) to use model-based estimators for fisheries operating in the Atlantic Ocean [@babcockSimulationTestingModelBasedDesignBased2023]. -->
