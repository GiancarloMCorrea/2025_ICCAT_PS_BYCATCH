Precision in bycatch estimates: the case of tuna purse-seine fisheries in the Indian Ocean. -- ICES Journal of Marine Science, 69: . Estimating bycatch, i.e. the incidental catch of non-target marine animals and undersized individuals of target species, by raising observer data to the whole fishery is routine practice. The annual bycatch of the European tropical tuna purse-seine fishery over the period 2003--2009 was estimated at 11 590 t [95\% confidence interval: (8165--15 818 t)], corresponding to 4.7\% of the tuna landings. An analysis of the variability in the precision of this estimate, based on generalized linear models and Monte Carlo simulations, showed that the current sampling coverage of the tropical tuna fishery observer programme, which is 4.6\% of the fishing trips, resulted in large uncertainties in bycatch estimates by species, i.e. none of the estimates have a relative root mean square error smaller than 50\%. Although the overall magnitude of bycatch of the fishery appeared to be small, the current sampling coverage was insufficient to give any reliable estimate for low-occurring species, such as marine turtles, some oceanic pelagic sharks, and some billfishes. Increasing the sampling coverage would likely improve bycatch estimates. Simulation outputs were produced to help define (i) trade-offs between the priority species to be monitored, (ii) the estimation precision, (iii) expected accuracy, and (iv) the associated sampling costs.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Modeling and understanding the catch rate dynamics of marine species is extremely important for fisheries management and conservation. For oceanic highly migratory species in particular, usually only fishery-dependent data are available which have limitations in the assumption of independence and if often zero-inflated and/or overdispersed. We tested different modeling approaches applied to the case study of blue shark in the South Atlantic, by using generalized linear models (GLMs), generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs), and generalized estimating equations (GEEs), as well as different error distributions to deal with the presence of zeros in the data. We used fractional polynomials to deal with non-linearity in some of the explanatory variables. Operational (set level) data collected by onboard fishery observers, covering 762 longline sets (1,014,527 hooks) over a 9-year period (2008--2016), were used. One of the most important variables affecting catch rates is leader material, with increasing catches when wire leaders are used. Spatial and seasonal variables are also important, with higher catch rates expected toward temperate southern waters and eastern longitudes, particularly between July and September. Environmental variables, especially SST, also affect catches. There were no major differences in the parameters estimated with GLMs, GLMMs, or GEEs; however, the use of GLMMs or GEEs should be more appropriate due to fishery dependence in the data. Comparing those two approaches, GLMMs seem to perform better in terms of goodness-of-fit and model validation.},

Here we establish integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) and stochastic partial differential equations (SPDE) as two powerful tools for modelling patterns of bycatch through time and space. These novel, computationally fast approaches are applied to fit zero-inflated hierarchical spatiotemporal models to Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) bycatch data from the Baffin Bay Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) gillnet fishery. Results indicate that Greenland shark bycatch is clustered in space and time, varies significantly from year to year, and there are both tractable factors (number of gillnet panels, total Greenland halibut catch) and physical features (bathymetry) leading to the high incidence of Greenland shark bycatch. Bycatch risk could be reduced by limiting access to spatiotemporal hotspots or by establishing a maximum number of panels per haul. Our method explicitly models the spatiotemporal correlation structure inherent in bycatch data at a very reasonable computational cost, such that the forecasting of bycatch patterns and simulating conservation strategies becomes more accessible.},

  abstract = {The rapid expansion of human activities threatens ocean-wide biodiversity. Numerous marine animal populations have declined, yet it remains unclear whether these trends are symptomatic of a chronic accumulation of global marine extinction risk. We present the first systematic analysis of threat for a globally distributed lineage of 1,041 chondrichthyan fishes---sharks, rays, and chimaeras. We estimate that one-quarter are threatened according to IUCN Red List criteria due to overfishing (targeted and incidental). Large-bodied, shallow-water species are at greatest risk and five out of the seven most threatened families are rays. Overall chondrichthyan extinction risk is substantially higher than for most other vertebrates, and only one-third of species are considered safe. Population depletion has occurred throughout the world's ice-free waters, but is particularly prevalent in the Indo-Pacific Biodiversity Triangle and Mediterranean Sea. Improved management of fisheries and trade is urgently needed to avoid extinctions and promote population recovery.           ,              Ocean ecosystems are under pressure from overfishing, climate change, habitat destruction and pollution. These pressures have led to documented declines of some fishes in some places, such as those living in coral reefs and on the high seas. However, it is not clear whether these population declines are isolated one-off examples or, instead, if they are sufficiently widespread to risk the extinction of large numbers of species.             Most fishes have a skeleton that is made of bone, but sharks and rays have a skeleton that is made of cartilage. A total of 1,041 species has such a skeleton and they are collectively known as the Chondrichthyes. To find out how well these fish are faring, Dulvy et al. worked with more than 300 scientists around the world to assess the conservation status of all 1,041 species.             Based on this, Dulvy et al. estimate that one in four of these species are threatened with extinction, mainly as a result of overfishing. Moreover, just 389 species (37.4\% of the total) are considered to be safe, which is the lowest fraction of safe species among all vertebrate groups studied to date.             The largest sharks and rays are in the most peril, especially those living in shallow waters that are accessible to fisheries. A particular problem is the `fin trade': the fins of sharks and shark-like rays are a delicacy in some Asian countries, and more than half of the chondrichthyans that enter the fin trade are under threat. Whether targeted or caught by boats fishing for other species, sharks and rays are used to supply a market that is largely unmonitored and unregulated. Habitat degradation and loss also pose considerable threats, particularly for freshwater sharks and rays.             Dulvy et al. identified three main hotspots where the biodiversity of sharks and rays was particularly seriously threatened---the Indo-Pacific Biodiversity Triangle, Red Sea, and the Mediterranean Sea---and argue that national and international action is needed to protect them from overfishing.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Bycatch rates are essential to estimating fishery impacts and making management decisions, but data on bycatch are often limited. Tropical tuna purse seine (PS) fisheries catch numerous bycatch species, including vulnerable silky sharks. Even if bycatch proportion is relatively low, impacts on pelagic ecosystems may be important due to the large size of these fisheries. Partial observer coverage of bycatch is a major impediment to assessing impacts. Here we develop a generic {$\Delta$} modeling approach for predicting catch of four major bycatch species, including silky sharks, in floating object-associated fishing sets of the French Indian Ocean PS fleet from 2011 to 2018 based on logbook and observer data. Cross-validation and variable selection are used to identify optimal models consisting of a random forest model for presence--absence and a negative binomial general-additive model for abundance when present. Though models explain small to moderate amounts of variance (5--15\%), they outperform a simpler approach commonly used for reporting, and they allow us to estimate total annual bycatch for the four species with robust estimates of uncertainty. Interestingly, uncertainty relative to mean catch is lower for top predators than forage species, consistent with these species having similar behavior and ecological niches to tunas.},

The Indian Ocean longline fisheries are taken as an example. This paper evaluates the potential bias in the relationship between local CPUE and abundance when fisheries are increasing their fishing effort. A presentation of the Indian Ocean longline fisheries is carried out. A statistical analysis of CPUE is conducted using a generalized additive model which tends to indicate that the local effort is an important component in the statistical behaviour of the local CPUE. A migratory model in which both resources and fisheries are mobile was built. This model simulates the combined exploitation of two species, a target and a bycatch species, both fished at increasing intensity. This model confirms the potential bias as a result of the concentration of fishing effort in areas of high density of the target species. It also suggests that the CPUE of bycatch species may be more heavily biased because of their status. It is recommended that local fishing efforts should preferably be taken into account in order to calculate the CPUE of both target and non-target species.},

The analyses presented were designed to establish the first quantitative baseline of historical catches, catch rates and species composition for the dominant tuna fisheries operating in the western and central Pacific, the world's largest in terms of tuna catch. Using records from 612,148 fishing events collected by independent `at sea' observers, estimates for finfish, billfish, elasmobranchs, marine mammals and sea turtles show that the composition and magnitude of catches varied considerably by fishery type and practice for the period 2003--2019. Simulations indicated that precision in longline estimates would be improved by monitoring a proportion of fishing sets from all fishing trips rather than full coverage from a proportion of all fishing trips. While attributing reasons for temporal trends in estimated bycatch was difficult due to the confounding impacts of changing abundances and fishing practices, the trends identified the nature of potential relationships for species that are not accurately quantified, or not covered, by fishing vessel logbooks. The trends in catch estimates, and the catch rate models, have utility in identifying species which may require targeted additional analyses and management interventions, including species of conservation interest (either due to their threatened status or vulnerability to fishing) such as elasmobranchs and sea turtles. Moreover, the estimates should support future evaluations of the impact of these industrial-scale fisheries on bycatch species.},

Bycatch estimates are typically calculated using data collected by on-board observers, but observer programmes are costly and therefore often only cover a small percentage of the fishery. The challenge is then to estimate bycatch for the unobserved fishing activity. The status quo for most fisheries is to assume the ratio of bycatch to effort is constant and multiply this ratio by the effort in the unobserved activity (ratio estimator). We used a dataset with 100\% observer coverage, 35~440 hauls from the US west coast groundfish trawl fishery, to evaluate the ratio estimator against methods that utilize fine-scale spatial information: generalized additive models (GAMs) and random forests. Applied to 15 species representing a range of bycatch rates, including spatial locations improved model predictive ability, whereas including effort-associated covariates generally did not. Random forests performed best for all species (lower root mean square error), but were slightly biased (overpredicting total bycatch). Thus, the choice of bycatch estimation method involves a tradeoff between bias and precision, and which method is optimal may depend on the species bycatch rate and how the estimates are to be used.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Indices of abundance are the bedrock for stock assessments or empirical management procedures used to manage fishery catches for fish populations worldwide, and are generally obtained by processing catch-rate data. Recent research suggests that geostatistical models can explain a substantial portion of variability in catch rates via the location of samples (i.e. whether located in high- or low-density habitats), and thus use available catch-rate data more efficiently than conventional ``design-based'' or stratified estimators. However, the generality of this conclusion is currently unknown because geostatistical models are computationally challenging to simulation-test and have not previously been evaluated using multiple species. We develop a new maximum likelihood estimator for geostatistical index standardization, which uses recent improvements in estimation for Gaussian random fields. We apply the model to data for 28 groundfish species off the U.S. West Coast and compare results to a previous ``stratified'' index standardization model, which accounts for spatial variation using post-stratification of available data. This demonstrates that the stratified model generates a relative index with 60\% larger estimation intervals than the geostatistical model. We also apply both models to simulated data and demonstrate (i) that the geostatistical model has well-calibrated confidence intervals (they include the true value at approximately the nominal rate), (ii) that neither model on average under- or overestimates changes in abundance, and (iii) that the geostatistical model has on average 20\% lower estimation errors than a stratified model. We therefore conclude that the geostatistical model uses survey data more efficiently than the stratified model, and therefore provides a more cost-efficient treatment for historical and ongoing fish sampling data.},

  abstract = {Fisheries scientists provide stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments to support interdisplinary fisheries management in the US and worldwide. These assessment activities have evolved different models, using different review standards, and are communicated using different vocabulary. Recent research shows that spatio-temporal models can estimate population density for multiple locations, times, and species, and that this is a ``common currency'' for addressing core goals in stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments. I therefore review the history and ``design principles'' for one spatio-temporal modelling package, the Vector Autoregressive SpatioTemporal (VAST) package. I then provide guidance on fifteen major decisions that must be made by users of VAST, including: whether to use a univariate or multivariate model; when to include spatial and/or spatiotemporal variation; how many factors to use within a multivariate model; whether to include density or catchability covariates; and when to include a temporal correlation on model components. I finally demonstrate these decisions using three case studies. The first develops indices of abundance, distribution shift, and range expansion for arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias) in the Eastern Bering Sea, showing the range expansion for this species. The second involves ``species ordination'' of eight groundfishes in the Gulf of Alaska bottom trawl survey, which highlights the different spatial distribution of flathead sole (Hippoglossoides elassodon) relative to sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) and dover sole (Microstomus pacificus). The third involves a short-term forecast of the proportion of coastwide abundance for five groundfishes within three spatial strata in the US West Coast groundfish bottom trawl survey, and predicts large interannual variability (and high uncertainty) in the distribution of lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus). I conclude by recommending further research exploring the benefits and limitations of a ``common currency'' approach to stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments, and discuss extending this approach to optimal survey design and economic assessments.},

  abstract = {Summary                                                                                                                           Changing climate is already impacting the spatial distribution of many taxa, including bees, plants, birds, butterflies and fishes. A common goal is to detect range shifts in response to climate change, including changes in the centre of the population's distribution (the centre of gravity,                       COG                       ), population boundaries and area occupied. Conventional estimators, such as the abundance-weighted average (                       AWA                       ) estimator for                       COG                       , confound range shifts with changes in the spatial distribution of available survey data and may be biased when the distribution of survey data shifts over time.                       AWA                       also does not estimate the standard error of                       COG                       in individual years and cannot incorporate data from multiple survey designs.                                                                                                       To explicitly account for changes in the spatial distribution of survey effort, we propose an alternative species distribution function (                       SDF                       ) estimator. The                       SDF                       approach involves calculating distribution metrics, including                       COG                       , population boundary and area occupied, directly from the predicted species distribution or density function. We illustrate the                       SDF                       approach using a spatiotemporal model that is available as an                       r                       package. Using simulated data, we confirm that the                       SDF                       substantially decreases bias in                       COG                       estimates relative to the                       AWA                       estimator. We then illustrate the method by analysing data from two data sets spanning 1977--2013 for 18 marine fishes along the U.S. West Coast.                                                                                                       In our case study, the                       SDF                       estimator shows significant northward shifts for six of 18 species (with southward shifts for only 2), where two species (darkblotched and greenstriped rockfishes) have both a northward shift and a decreased area occupied. Pelagic species (e.g. Pacific hake and spiny dogfish) have more variable distribution than bottom-associated species. We also find substantial differences between                       AWA                       and                       SDF                       estimates of                       COG                       that are likely caused by shifts in sampling distribution (which affect the                       AWA                       but not the                       SDF                       estimator).                                                                                We caution that common estimators for range shift can yield inappropriate inference whenever sampling designs have shifted over time. We conclude by suggesting further improvements in model-based approaches to analysing climate impacts, including methods addressing the impact of local and regional temperature changes on species distribution.},

  abstract = {Excess bycatch of marine species during commercial fishing trips is a challenging problem in fishery management worldwide. The aims of this paper are twofold: to introduce methods and provide a practical guide for spatiotemporal modelling of bycatch data, as well as to apply these methods and present a thorough examination of Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) bycatch weight in a Canadian Arctic fishery. We introduce the spatially explicit two-part model and offer a step by step guide for applying the model to any form of bycatch data, from data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, variable and model selection, model checking, to results interpretation. We address various problems encountered in decision making and suggest that researchers proceed cautiously and always keep in mind the aims of the analysis when fitting a spatiotemporal model. Results identified spatiotemporal hotspots and indicated month and gear type were key drivers of high bycatch. The importance of onboard observers in providing robust bycatch data was also evident. These findings will help to inform conservation strategies and management decisions, such as limiting access to spatial hotspots, seasonal closures and gear restrictions.},
