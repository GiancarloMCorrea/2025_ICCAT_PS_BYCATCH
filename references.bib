  abstract = {Geostatistical spatial or spatiotemporal data are common across scientific fields. However, appropriate models to analyse these data, such as generalised linear mixed effects models (GLMMs) with Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs), are computationally intensive and challenging for many users to implement. Here, we introduce the R package sdmTMB, which extends the flexible interface familiar to users of lme4, glmmTMB, and mgcv to include spatial and spatiotemporal latent GMRFs using an SPDE-(stochastic partial differential equation) based approach. SPDE matrices are constructed with fmesher and estimation is conducted via maximum marginal likelihood with TMB or via Bayesian inference with tmbstan and rstan. We describe the model and explore case studies that illustrate sdmTMB's flexibility in implementing penalised smoothers, non-stationary processes (time-varying and spatially varying coefficients), hurdle models, cross-validation and anisotropy (directionally dependent spatial correlation). Finally, we compare the functionality, speed, and interfaces of related software, demonstrating that sdmTMB can be an order of magnitude faster than R-INLA. We hope sdmTMB's accessible interface will help open this useful class of models to a wider field of geostatistical analysts.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract = {Summary                                                                Predicting and explaining the distribution and density of species is one of the oldest concerns in ecology. Species distributions can be estimated using geostatistical methods, which estimate a latent spatial variable explaining observed variation in densities, but geostatistical methods may be imprecise for species with low densities or few observations. Additionally, simple geostatistical methods fail to account for correlations in distribution among species and generally estimate such cross-correlations as a post hoc exercise.                                                                          We therefore present spatial factor analysis (                     SFA                     ), a spatial model for estimating a low-rank approximation to multivariate data, and use it to jointly estimate the distribution of multiple species simultaneously. We also derive an analytic estimate of cross-correlations among species from                     SFA                     parameters.                                                                                             As a first example, we show that distributions for 10 bird species in the breeding bird survey in 2012 can be parsimoniously represented using only five spatial factors. As a second case study, we show that forward prediction of catches for 20 rockfishes (                                            S                       ebastes                                          spp.) off the                     U                     .                     S                     .                     W                     est                     C                     oast is more accurate using                     SFA                     than analysing each species individually. Finally, we show that single-species models give a different picture of cross-correlations than joint estimation using                     SFA                     .                                                                        Spatial factor analysis complements a growing list of tools for jointly modelling the distribution of multiple species and provides a parsimonious summary of cross-correlation without requiring explicit declaration of habitat variables. We conclude by proposing future research that would model species cross-correlations using dissimilarity of species' traits, and the development of spatial dynamic factor analysis for a low-rank approximation to spatial time-series data.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Aim                                Multivariate spatio-temporal models are widely applicable, but specifying their structure is complicated and may inhibit wider use. We introduce the R package                 tinyVAST                 from two viewpoints: the software user and the statistician.                                                        Innovation                                From the user viewpoint,                 tinyVAST                 adapts a widely used formula interface to specify generalised additive models and combines this with arguments to specify spatial and spatio-temporal interactions among variables. These interactions are specified using arrow notation (from structural equation models) or an extended arrow-and-lag notation that allows simultaneous, lagged and recursive dependencies among variables over time. The user also specifies a spatial domain for areal (gridded), continuous (point-count) or stream-network data. From the statistician viewpoint,                 tinyVAST                 constructs sparse precision matrices representing multivariate spatio-temporal variation, and parameters are estimated by specifying a generalised linear mixed model (GLMM). This expressive interface encompasses vector autoregressive, empirical orthogonal functions, spatial factor analysis and ARIMA models.                                                        Main Conclusion                                To demonstrate, we fit to data from two survey platforms sampling corals, sponges, rockfishes and flatfishes in the Gulf of Alaska and Aleutian Islands. We then compare eight alternative model structures using different assumptions about habitat drivers and survey detectability. Model selection suggests that towed-camera and bottom trawl gears have spatial variation in detectability but sample the same underlying density of flatfishes and rockfishes and that rockfishes are positively associated with sponges while flatfishes are negatively associated with corals. We conclude that                 tinyVAST                 can be used to test complicated dependencies representing alternative structural hypotheses for research and real-world policy evaluation.},
